# Non-Functional Requirements Document

## 1. Performance Requirements
- The system should support **fast response times** (< 1s for most operations).
- It should handle **concurrent users efficiently** (e.g., multiple members borrowing books simultaneously).
- The **search functionality** should return results within **500ms** for typical queries.

## 2. Scalability Requirements
- The system should be **horizontally scalable** to handle increased user traffic (e.g., growing from 100 to 10,000 users).
- Support **database sharding or replication** if the dataset grows (e.g., millions of books).

## 3. Security Requirements
### Authentication & Authorization
- Use **Spring Security** with **JWT/OAuth2** for secure access.
- Enforce **role-based access control (RBAC)** (Librarian vs. Member).

### Data Protection
- Store **user passwords** using **hashed and salted encryption** (e.g., BCrypt).
- Encrypt **sensitive data** such as user details.

### Access Control
- Restrict **admin functionalities** (only Librarians can manage books/users).
- Prevent **unauthorized access** to APIs.

## 4. Availability & Reliability
- The system should have **99.9% uptime**, excluding planned maintenance.
- Implement **database backups** and **disaster recovery mechanisms**.
- Use **circuit breakers (Resilience4j)** to prevent system crashes due to failures.

## 5. Maintainability & Extensibility
- The code should follow **clean architecture principles** (layered architecture in Spring Boot).
- Implement **modular design** to allow easy addition of new features (e.g., e-books, memberships).
- Use **RESTful APIs** for integration with third-party services (e.g., payment gateways for fines).

## 6. Usability & Accessibility
- The system should have a **user-friendly interface** (if using a front-end like React/Angular).
- Support **mobile-friendly design**.
- Ensure **accessibility compliance (WCAG guidelines)** for visually impaired users.

## 7. Logging & Monitoring
- Implement **centralized logging** (e.g., **ELK Stack** - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
- Monitor **system health** using **Prometheus + Grafana**.
- Generate **audit logs** for user activities (borrowing, returning, payments).

## 8. Compliance & Legal Requirements
- Follow **GDPR** or **data protection laws** (if storing user data).
- Ensure proper **record-keeping** of borrowed books and payments.

## 9. Compatibility & Integration
- The system should work on **Windows, Linux, and cloud environments**.
- It should be **deployable** on **AWS/GCP/Azure**.
- Provide **API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)** for external integrations.

## 10. Fault Tolerance & Disaster Recovery
- Use **database replication** for **failover support**.
- Implement **automatic retry mechanisms** for failed transactions.
- Have a **backup strategy** (daily, weekly snapshots).
